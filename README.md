# ChimeraQuest
A demo of a game incorporating generative AI within gameplay. 
(this is my first open source repo; apologies for not making it super easy to emulate). 

I discuss this game here: https://medium.com/@sampeck/taming-gpt-two-projects-demonstrating-the-potential-of-generative-ai-within-games-16e3afa3ffa0

# Getting Started
To play quickly, ask Sam (https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-peck-4078b415/) to invite you to the Discord Server where this is running. 
To get this up and running for yourself, continue reading.

# Pre-requisites
1. An OpenAI account and key (‘OPENAI_API_KEY’)
2. A StabilityAI account and key (‘STABILITY_KEY’)
3. A discord bot to connect to (‘BREEDQUEST_BOT_TOKEN’)
4. A clone of the Google Sheets Backend (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dgBh7knamwzkY6dmXI9grpPy2igVfLaNxlqzXS8t-RA/edit#gid=1316813655) and a Service Account to read and write to this Sheets (‘SHEETS_LOGGER_CREDENTIALS’). 

You will notice that the sheets has incomplete data; the python files animalLamarksGenerator.py, animalPropertyGenerator.py, and questGenerator.py are for generating content for the game.
